Each year, we produce nearly 46 million man-hours, and our work boasts a safety experience rate five times better than the industry average. Much of our work locally and nationally involves complex and challenging heavy civil and transit projects. Skanskaâ€™s core values underscore all we do: Care for Life. Act ethically and transparently. Be better, together. Commit to Customers. We look forward to applying these values to engage with the Cities of DuPont, Lakewood, Steilacoom, Yelm and Lacey, Joint Base Lewis McChord, as well as the local stakeholders, residents and businesses who truly bring life to these communities.</p>
